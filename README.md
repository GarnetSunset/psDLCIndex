# psDLCIndex
Playstation Store DLC Indexer, and list generator.

## What is this?
 
This is a script that will go through a playstation store entry for a certain title, which is given at runtime, and get the titleIDS of all DLC associated with them. 

## How to use?

Make sure you run "requirements.bat" if you're on windows, but then, just run the "dlcIndex.py" script and input the Full URL or Content_ID or CUSAxxxxx of the app you wish to crawl. This can take a while so be patient.
