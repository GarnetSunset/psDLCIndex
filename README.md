# psDLCIndex
Playstation Store DLC Indexer, and list generator.

## What is this?
 
This is a script that will go through a playstation store entry for a certain title, which is given at runtime, and get the 
titleIDS of all DLC associated with them. 

## How to use?

Make sure you run "requirements.bat" if you're on windows, but then, just run the "dlcIndex.py" script and input the full title ID of the 
app you wish to crawl. This can take a while so be patient.
